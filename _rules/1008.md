title: Avoid static classes
severity: 3
---
With the exception of extension method containers, static classes very often lead to badly designed code. They are also very difficult, if not impossible, to test in isolation, unless you're willing to use some very hacky tools.

**Note:** If you really need that static class, mark it as static so that the compiler can prevent instance members and instantiating your class. This relieves you of creating an explicit private constructor.
