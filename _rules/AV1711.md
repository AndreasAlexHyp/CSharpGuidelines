rule-id: AV1711
title: Name members similarly to members of related .NET Framework classes
severity: 3
---
.NET developers are already accustomed to the naming patterns the framework uses, so following this same pattern helps them find their way in your classes as well. For instance, if you define a class that behaves like a collection, provide members like `Add`, `Remove` and `Count` instead of `AddItem`, `Delete` or `NumberOfItems`.
