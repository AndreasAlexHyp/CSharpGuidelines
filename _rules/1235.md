title: Don't pass `null` as the `sender` argument when raising an event
severity: 1
---
Often an event handler is used to handle similar events from multiple senders. The sender argument is then used to get to the source of the event. Always pass a reference to the source (typically `this`) when raising the event. Furthermore don't pass `null` as the event data parameter when raising an event. If there is no event data, pass `EventArgs.Empty` instead of `null`.

**Exception:** On static events, the sender argument should be `null`.
