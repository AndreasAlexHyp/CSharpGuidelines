title: Should use `async` for all public methods
severity: 2
---
The usage of `async` adds the necessary logic to allow releasing the current thread, and marshal the result back on that same thread if a long-running asynchronous operation has completed. The majority of all public methods typically resolve in out of process operations like read/write to a database, http calls, publishing events etc, so we can concider them as perfect candidates to be awaitable.
