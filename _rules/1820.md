title: Only use `async` for low-intensive long-running activities
severity: 1
---
The usage of `async` won't automagically run something on a worker thread like `Task.Run` does. It just adds the necessary logic to allow releasing the current thread, and marshal the result back on that same thread if a long-running asynchronous operation has completed. In other words, use `async` only for I/O bound operations.
