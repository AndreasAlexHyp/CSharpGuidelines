title: Only write comments to explain complex algorithms or decisions
severity: 1
---
Try to focus comments on the *why* and *what* of a code block and not the *how*. Avoid explaining the statements in words, but instead help the reader understand why you chose a certain solution or algorithm and what you are trying to achieve. If applicable, also mention that you chose an alternative solution because you ran into a problem with the obvious solution.
