title: Should not throw exceptions to control execution flow of the business logic
severity: 3
---
Structured exception handling has been introduced to allow you to throw exceptions and catch or replace them at a higher layer but never the less should not be used to stop execution flow of the business logic, instead execution of the business logic should return/break gracefully.
