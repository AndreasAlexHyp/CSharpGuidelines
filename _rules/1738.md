title: Prefix an event handler with "On"
severity: 3
---
It is good practice to prefix the method that handles an event with "On". For example, a method that handles its own `Closing` event should be named `OnClosing`. And a method that handles the `Click` event of its `okButton` field should be named `OkButtonOnClick`.
