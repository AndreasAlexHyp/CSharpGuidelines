title: Consider providing property-changed events
severity: 3
---
Consider providing events that are raised when certain properties are changed. Such an event should be named `PropertyChanged`, where `Property` should be replaced with the name of the property with which this event is associated

**Note:** If your class has many properties that require corresponding events, consider implementing the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface instead. It is often used in the [Presentation Model](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html) and [Model-View-ViewModel](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx) patterns.
