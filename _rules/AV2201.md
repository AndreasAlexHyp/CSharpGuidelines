title: Use C# type aliases instead of the types from the `System` namespace
severity: 1
---
For instance, use `object` instead of `Object`, `string` instead of `String`, and `int` instead of `Int32`. These aliases have been introduced to make the primitive types first class citizens of the C# language, so use them accordingly.

**Exception:** When referring to static members of those types, it is custom to use the full CLS name, e.g. `Int32.Parse()` instead of `int.Parse()`. The same applies to members that need to specify the type they return, e.g. `ReadInt32`, `GetUInt16`.
