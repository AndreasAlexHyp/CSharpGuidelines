title: Classes should have state and behavior
severity: 1
---
In general, if you find a lot of data-only classes in your code base, you probably also have a few (static) classes with a lot of behavior (see [AV1008](#av1008)). Use the principles of object-orientation explained in this section and move the logic close to the data it applies to.

**Exception:** The only exceptions to this rule are classes that are used to transfer data over a communication channel, also called [Data Transfer Objects](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html), or a class that wraps several parameters of a method.
