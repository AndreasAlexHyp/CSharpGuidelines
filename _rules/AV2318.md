title: Don't use comments for tracking work to be done later
severity: 3
---
Annotating a block of code or some work to be done using a *TODO* or similar comment may seem a reasonable way of tracking work-to-be-done. But in reality, nobody really searches for comments like that. Use a work item tracking system to keep track of leftovers.
