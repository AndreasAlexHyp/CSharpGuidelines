title: Properly handle exceptions in asynchronous code
severity: 2
---
When throwing or handling exceptions in code that uses `async`/`await` or a `Task` remember the following two rules:

- Exceptions that occur within an `async`/`await` block and inside a `Task`'s action are propagated to the awaiter.
- Exceptions that occur in the code preceding the asynchronous block are propagated to the caller.
