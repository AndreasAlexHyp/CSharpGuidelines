title: Beware of `async`/`await` deadlocks in single-threaded environments
severity: 1
---
Consider the following asynchronous method:

	private async Task GetDataAsync()
	{
		var result = await MyWebService.GetDataAsync();
		return result.ToString();
	}

Now when an ASP.NET MVC controller action does this:

	public ActionResult ActionAsync()
	{
		var data = GetDataAsync().Result;
		
		return View(data);  
	}

You end up with a deadlock. Why? Because the `Result` property getter will block until the `async` operation has completed, but since an `async` method _could_ automatically marshal the result back to the original thread (depending on the current `SynchronizationContext` or `TaskScheduler`) and ASP.NET uses a single-threaded synchronization context, they'll be waiting on each other. A similar problem can also happen on UWP, WPF or a Windows Store C#/XAML app. Read more about this [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/01/13/10115163.aspx).
