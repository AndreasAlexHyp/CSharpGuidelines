title: Don't use abbreviations
severity: 2
---
For example, use `ButtonOnClick` rather than `BtnOnClick`. Avoid single character variable names, such as `i` or `q`. Use `index` or `query` instead.

**Exceptions:** Use well-known acronyms and abbreviations that are widely accepted or well-known in your work domain. For instance, use acronym `UI` instead of `UserInterface` and abbreviation `Id` instead of `Identity`.
