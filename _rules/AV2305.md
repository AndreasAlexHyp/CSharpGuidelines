Documenting your code allows Visual Studio, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) to pop-up the documentation when your class is used somewhere else. Furthermore, by properly documenting your classes, tools can generate professionally looking class documentation.
