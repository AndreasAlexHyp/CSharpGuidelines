title: Use an interface rather than a base class to support multiple implementations
severity: 3
---
If you want to expose an extension point from your class, expose it as an interface rather than as a base class. You don't want to force users of that extension point to derive their implementations from a base class that might have an undesired behavior. However, for their convenience you may implement a(n abstract) default implementation that can serve as a starting point.
