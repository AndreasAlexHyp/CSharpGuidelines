title: Don't swallow errors by catching generic exceptions
severity: 1
---
Avoid swallowing errors by catching non-specific exceptions, such as `Exception`, `SystemException`, and so on, in application code. Only in top-level code, such as a last-chance exception handler, you should catch a non-specific exception for logging purposes and a graceful shutdown of the application.
