title: Do not use `#region` unless is really needed

Regions require extra work without increasing the quality or the readability of code. Instead they make code harder to view and refactor. Nested regions should never by used.

**Exception:** You can use regions in case you want to group members by type.
    
        public class Order
        {
            #region Public Properties

            public string CustomerCode { get; private set; }
            public string ItemCode { get; private set; }
            public int Quantity { get; private set; }
            public string Coupon { get; private set; }

            #endregion

            #region Constructor

            public Order(string customerCode, string itemCode, int quantity, string coupon)
            {
                this.CustomerCode = customerCode;
                this.ItemCode = itemCode;
                this.Quantity = quantity;
                this.Coupon = coupon;
            }

            #endregion
        }
