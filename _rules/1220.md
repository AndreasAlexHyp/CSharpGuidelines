title: Always check an event handler delegate for `null`
severity: 1
---
An event that has no subscribers is `null`. So before invoking, always make sure that the delegate list represented by the event variable is not `null`.
Invoke using the null conditional operator, because it additionally prevents conflicting changes to the delegate list from concurrent threads.

	event EventHandler<NotifyEventArgs> Notify;

	protected virtual void OnNotify(NotifyEventArgs args)
	{
		Notify?.Invoke(this, args);
	}
