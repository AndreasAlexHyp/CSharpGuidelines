rule-id: AV1130
title: Return an `IEnumerable<T>` or `ICollection<T>` instead of a concrete collection class
severity: 2
---
You generally don't want callers to be able to change an internal collection, so don't return arrays, lists or other collection classes directly. Instead, return an `IEnumerable<T>`, or, if the caller must be able to determine the count, an `ICollection<T>`.

**Note:** If you're using .NET 4.5 or higher, you can also use `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`, `IReadOnlyList<T>` or `IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>`.

**Exception:** Immutable collections such as `ImmutableArray<T>`, `ImmutableList<T>` and `ImmutableDictionary<TKey, TValue>` prevent modifications from the outside and are thus allowed.
