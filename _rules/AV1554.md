title: Do not use optional parameters in interface methods or their concrete implementations
severity: 1
---
When an interface method defines an optional parameter, its default value is discarded during overload resolution unless you call the concrete class through the interface reference.

When a concrete implementation of an interface method sets a default argument for a parameter, the default value is discarded during overload resolution if you call the concrete class through the interface reference.
