title: Only create a constructor that returns a useful object
severity: 3

There should be no need to set additional properties before the object can be used for whatever purpose it was designed. However, if your constructor needs more than three parameters (which violates [AV1561](/maintainability-guidelines#av1561)), your class might have too much responsibility (and violates [AV1000](#av1000)).
