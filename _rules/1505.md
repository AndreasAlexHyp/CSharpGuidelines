title: Name assemblies after their contained namespace
severity: 3
---
**Backend:** All DLLs should be named according to the pattern *Company*.*BoundedContext*.*Component*.dll where *Company* refers to your company's name, *BoundedContext* refers to the logical boundary of your microservice and *Component* contains one or more dot-separated clauses. For example `Hyperio.Assets.Api.dll`.

As an example, consider a group of classes organized under the namespace `Hyperio.Assets.Domain.Aggregates` exposed by a certain assembly. According to this guideline, that assembly should be called `Hyperio.Assets.Domain.dll`.

**Web:** All DLLs should be named according to the pattern *Company*.*Component*.Web.dll where *Company* refers to your company's name and *Component* contains one or more dot-separated components. For example `Hyperio.OperatorsPortal.Web.dll`.

**Exception:** The exception to the above rule are cross cutting concern assemblies where they are named according to the pattern *Company*.Common.*CrossCuttingConcern*.dll. For example, `Hyperio.Common.Messaging.dll`.
