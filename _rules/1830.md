title: Beware of mixing up `async`/`await` with `Task.Wait`
severity: 1
---
`await` does not block the current thread but simply instructs the compiler to generate a state-machine. However, `Task.Wait` blocks the thread and may even cause deadlocks (see [{{ site.default_rule_prefix }}1835](#{{ site.default_rule_prefix }}1835)).
