title: Only use the `dynamic` keyword when talking to a dynamic object
severity: 1
---
The `dynamic` keyword has been introduced for working with dynamic languages. Using it introduces a serious performance bottleneck because the compiler has to generate some complex Reflection code.

Use it only for calling methods or members of a dynamically created instance class (using the `Activator`) as an alternative to `Type.GetProperty()` and `Type.GetMethod()`, or for working with COM Interop types.
