rule-id: AV1720
title: Name methods and local functions using verbs or verb-object pairs
severity: 2
---
Name a method or local function using a verb like `Show` or a verb-object pair such as `ShowDialog`. A good name should give a hint on the *what* of a member, and if possible, the *why*.

Also, don't include `And` in the name of a method or local function. That implies that it is doing more than one thing, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle explained in [AV1115](/member-design-guidelines#av1115).
