title: Avoid conditions with double negatives
severity: 2
---
Although a property like `customer.HasNoOrders` makes sense, avoid using it in a negative condition like this:

	bool hasOrders = !customer.HasNoOrders;

Double negatives are more difficult to grasp than simple expressions, and people tend to read over the double negative easily.
