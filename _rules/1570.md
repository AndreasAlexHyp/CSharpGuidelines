title: Prefer `is` patterns over `as` operations
severity: 1
---
If you use 'as' to safely upcast an interface reference to a certain type, always verify that the operation does not return `null`. Failure to do so may cause a `NullReferenceException` at a later stage if the object did not implement that interface.
Pattern matching syntax prevents this and improves readability. For example, instead of:

	var remoteUser = user as RemoteUser;
	if (remoteUser != null)
	{
	}

write:

	if (user is RemoteUser remoteUser)
	{
	}
