title: Don't comment out code
severity: 1
---
Never check in code that is commented out. Instead, use a work item tracking system to keep track of some work to be done. Nobody knows what to do when they encounter a block of commented-out code. Was it temporarily disabled for testing purposes? Was it copied as an example? Should I delete it?
