title: Avoid exposing the other objects an object depends on
severity: 2

If you find yourself writing code like this then you might be violating the [Law of Demeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter).

	someObject.SomeProperty.GetChild().Foo()

An object should not expose any other classes it depends on because callers may misuse that exposed property or method to access the object behind it. By doing so, you allow calling code to become coupled to the class you are using, and thereby limiting the chance that you can easily replace it in a future stage.

**Note:** Using a class that is designed using the [Fluent Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) pattern seems to violate this rule, but it is simply returning itself so that method chaining is allowed.

**Exception:** Inversion of Control or Dependency Injection frameworks often require you to expose a dependency as a public property. As long as this property is not used for anything other than dependency injection I would not consider it a violation.
