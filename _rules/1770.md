Naming standards are important because they explicitly express the intent of the test. Tests are more than just making sure your code works, they also provide documentation. Just by looking at the suite of unit tests, you should be able to infer the behavior of your code without even looking at the code itself. Additionally, when tests fail, you can see exactly which scenarios do not meet your expectations.

Tha name of your class containing the tests should be the same with the class being tested.

The name of your test should consist of three parts:

- The name of the method being tested.
- The scenario under which it's being tested.
- The expected behavior when the scenario is invoked.

Bad example:

	[Fact]
	public void Test_Single()
	{
		var stringCalculator = new StringCalculator();

		var actual = stringCalculator.Add("0");

		Assert.Equal(0, actual);
	}

Good example:

	[Fact]
	public void Add_SingleNumber_ReturnsSameNumber()
	{
		var stringCalculator = new StringCalculator();

		var actual = stringCalculator.Add("0");

		Assert.Equal(0, actual);
	}


Readability is one of the most important aspects when writing a test. Separating each of these actions within the test clearly highlight the dependencies required to call your code, how your code is being called, and what you are trying to assert. While it may be possible to combine some steps and reduce the size of your test, the primary goal is to make the test as readable as possible.

Bad example:

	[Fact]
	public void Add_EmptyString_ReturnsZero()
	{
		// Arrange
		var stringCalculator = new StringCalculator();

		// Assert
		Assert.Equal(0, stringCalculator.Add(""));
	}

Good example:

	[Fact]
	public void Add_EmptyString_ReturnsZero()
	{
		// Arrange
		var stringCalculator = new StringCalculator();

		// Act
		var actual = stringCalculator.Add("");

		// Assert
		Assert.Equal(0, actual);
	}
