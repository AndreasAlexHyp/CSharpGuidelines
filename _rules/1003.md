title: An interface should be small and focused
severity: 2
---
Interfaces should have a name that clearly explains their purpose or role in the system. Do not combine many vaguely related members on the same interface just because they were all on the same class. Separate the members based on the responsibility of those members, so that callers only need to call or implement the interface related to a particular task. This rule is more commonly known as the [Interface Segregation Principle](https://lostechies.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/pablos_solid_ebook.pdf).
