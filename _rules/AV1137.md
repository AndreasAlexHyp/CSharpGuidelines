title: Define parameters as specific as possible
severity: 2
---
If your method or local function needs a specific piece of data, define parameters as specific as that and don't take a container object instead. For instance, consider a method that needs a connection string that is exposed through a central `IConfiguration` interface. Rather than taking a dependency on the entire configuration, just define a parameter for the connection string. This not only prevents unnecessary coupling, it also improves maintainability in the long run.

**Note:** An easy trick to remember this guideline is the *Don't ship the truck if you only need a package*.
