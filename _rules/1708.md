title: Name types using nouns, noun phrases or adjective phrases
severity: 2
---
For example, the name IComponent uses a descriptive noun, ICustomAttributeProvider uses a noun phrase and IPersistable uses an adjective.
Bad examples include `SearchExamination` (a page to search for examinations), `Common` (does not end with a noun, and does not explain its purpose) and `SiteSecurity` (although the name is technically okay, it does not say anything about its purpose).

Don't include terms like `Utility` or `Helper` in classes. Classes with names like that are usually static classes and are introduced without considering object-oriented principles (see also [{{ site.default_rule_prefix }}1008](/member-design-guidelines#{{ site.default_rule_prefix }}1008)).
