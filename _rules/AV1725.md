rule-id: AV1725
title: Name namespaces using names, layers, verbs and features
severity: 3
---
For instance, the following namespaces are good examples of that guideline.

	AvivaSolutions.Commerce.Web
	NHibernate.Extensibility
	Microsoft.ServiceModel.WebApi
	Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugging
	FluentAssertion.Primitives
	CaliburnMicro.Extensions

**Note:** Never allow namespaces to contain the name of a type, but a noun in its plural form (e.g. `Collections`) is usually OK.
